## Work Experience

### Haptag AI — Project Contributor, Research Department (May 2025 – Present)
- Conducted research on Large Language Models for cybersecurity, implementing a DeepLog-based LSTM architecture for log anomaly detection with end-to-end data parsing, training, and inference.
- Built a Drain3-based log parsing system to convert raw logs into structured CSV format.
- Achieved 98.76% precision in anomaly detection via combined sequence- and token-level evaluation.
- Collaborated with engineering teams on model deployment, full-stack integration, testing, and performance benchmarking.

### Asakana — Software Engineer (June 2025 – August 2025)
- Built a Gen AI–powered SMS chatbot automating seafood order placement between businesses and suppliers, replacing manual calls and improving efficiency; backend implemented with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
- Integrated Twilio SMS and OpenAI LLMs to parse natural text into structured orders.
- Deployed on Render and piloted with 15 suppliers, receiving positive usability feedback.

### Visa Inc. — Software Engineer Intern (May 2023 – July 2023)
- Developed a Hive Lineage Connector for the Visa Datahub Metadata platform, expanding from single-query lineage to parsing hundreds of queries for key properties.
- Co-implemented a Java REST Emitter to transmit lineage details to Datahub.
- Authored extensive test suites to protect future features, cutting total project time by 20 hours.
